# Streamnesia

Streamnesia is a "Chaos Mod", meaning it changes what happens during your playthrough of the game. Your screen can be upside down for a minute, or maybe all doors unlock. In the base package, there are around 40 different events.

## Install & Play

1. See the [Release Page](https://github.com/petrspelos/Streamnesia/releases) and download a build of the mod
2. Follow [This YouTube guide](https://youtu.be/tnXvUmFc-84) to setup Streamnesia

## Contributing & Building
